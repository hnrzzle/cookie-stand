            <p><img src="frosted-cookie.jpg" alt="cookie" id="cookieimg"/> <h2>History</h2>Salmon Cookies was  first created one late September night by Salmon and Cookie lover Dr. Richard Trout. He wanted to combine the two things he loved more than anything in this world including his family; Salmon and Cookies. </p>
            <p>His product was an instant great hit, and he started selling them first just out of his home but it was clear, Dr. Trout was onto something huge. He opened up a store in Pioneer Square and the demand was so great he was forced to expand. Dr. Trout quit his fulltime job as a fish doctor to commit all his time to Salmon Cookies.</p>
